# Software-Engineering-project
 a Parking Garage application. This application manages a parking space for
a configurable maximum number of vehicles. Each parking space (slot) defined with a dimension
(width and depth) The application  handles the following functions: <br />
● Each vehicle shall be identified by a model name, unique identification number, Model year  
and vehicle dimensions (vehicle width and depth). <br />  
● Park-in function that marks the arrival time of a vehicle if there is an available slot. The
application shall capture such time automatically from the system. <br />
● During the park-in function the application shall pick a free slot based on the active slot
configuration. There are two configurations (i) first come first served slots i.e., the park-in
function will use the first free slot available from the parking garage slots. (ii) best-fit approach
where you need to find the slot with the minimum dimension to hold the vehicle. <br />
● Park-out function that marks the departure time of a vehicle from the garage. The application
shall capture such time automatically from the system. <br />
● Calculates the parking fees during the park-out based on the time-of-stay with an hourly rate
of 5 EGP. <br />
● Calculate the total income as well as the total number of vehicles that used the parking
garage at any given point in time. <br />
● Display the available parking slots <br />
● Enriched  with the capability to handle a set of exceptions that can happen
during user interaction and through any other calculations. <br />
